quetzal-dev
===========

Uber-repo for the Quetzal web component library. This references all Quetzal
repos as submodules, permitting easy read/write access to the whole collection.
This quetzal-dev repo cannot be deployed to GitHub Pages directly, because
Pages doesn't permit the use of read/write git: URLs for submodules. To deploy,
use the companion quetzal repo, which uses read-only URLs for submodules.
